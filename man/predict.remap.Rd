\title{Make predictions given a set of data and smooths predictions between regions.
If an observation is outside of all regions and smoothing distances, the
closest region will be used to predict.}
\usage{
\method{predict}{remap}(
  object,
  data,
  smooth,
  distances = NULL,
  threads = 1,
  progress = TRUE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\emph{} S3 object output from sboost.}

\item{data}{An sf dataframe with point geometry.}

\item{smooth}{The distance in km within a region where a smooth transition
to the next region starts. (Can be a named vector with different values for
each unique object$region_id' in 'object$region'.)}

\item{distances}{An optional matrix of distances between 'data' and
'object$regions' generated by redist() function (calculated
internally if not provided).}

\item{threads}{Number of threads for parallel computing. 'threads' above
default of 1 will require more memory.}

\item{progress}{If true, a text progress bar is printed to the console.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to individual model prediction functions.}
}
\value{
Predictions in the form of a vector.
